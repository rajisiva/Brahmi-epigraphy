# Brahmi-epigraphy

Introduction

Most of the ancient historical inscriptions and other forms of textual data were written in Brahmi. These inscriptions offer information about personages and events in Indian history, about which nothing is known from any other source. Brahmi serves as the base script for many languages in south Asian countries including Tamil. Temple epigraphy have long been preserved as physical estampages that are bound to deterioration. This makes digitization of the inscriptions important. The digitization of stone carved characters deals with more preprocessing and noise removal techniques. Unlike handwritten or printed documents the stones and temple walls almost exhibit the same color as foreground and background which makes the feature extraction more difficult. This paper uses Python Opencv library for converting the stone images into binarized (black background and white characters) form. It is important to transliterate the Brahmi characters into some other language since these symbols doesnâ€™t make any sense to the present world. Tamil is one of the oldest languages still in existence with rich literature which consists of 12 vowels, 18 consonants, 216 com-pound characters and 1 special character (Ayutha ezhuthu). Hence the recognized Brahmi characters are transliterated into Tamil through Tesseract OCR with an accuracy of 85%
